# Resume Builder
This was the Project I made for my college web development subject.
Technologies Used : HTML, CSS, JS and PHP.
It gives you preview of templates,customize the templates, update the resume and see dynamically the changes updating on right hand side of screen and even you can download it in required format like .pdf/.docx . Made with Smooth UI and Good Looking Interface Looking like a SAAS website.
Further I connected this it to a mysql db through myPHPadmin where I ensured login and signin authentication through it. Though there was no Session Management, sorryy.
I made it host on Github pages and used XAAMP server for localhost
